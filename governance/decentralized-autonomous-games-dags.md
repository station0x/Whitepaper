* **Decentralized.** Lives on-chain (i.e Dark Forrest)
* **Governable.** Can be modified by the players themselves.
* **Decentralized storage of assets.** IPFS-stored.&#x20;

Our games are highly-competitive real-time games that require high server specs and a fair amount of good server-client latency. Most existing blockchains are not designed to handle that type of computation.



Instead, Station Zero X is utilizing current blockchain technology for its underlying assets like game tokens and players' inventories. While also adding new functionality that makes our games move a step closer toward fully decentralized games, it's [Decentralized Modding.](decentralized-modding.md)
