Until finding a feasible approach to fully decentralize AAA games Station Zero X [**decentralized autonomous games**](decentralized-autonomous-games-dags.md) are governable by $SZX holders by:

* **Game balancing.** By buffing/nerfing weapons and abilities states through on-chain proposals.
* Adding new content like loot or quests.
* Altering game mechanics to deliver more immersive experiences.
* Content Add-ons.
