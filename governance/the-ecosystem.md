<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Revenue Model.drawio.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Station Zero X ecosystem is designed to the following things in mind:&#x20;

* Funnel the games-produced speculative value toward the governance token
* Penalize greedy-stakers and reward the most loyal stakeholders through mid-to-long incentives, unstaking taxation fee that goes back to the loyal stakers.
* Ensure both sustainability and accessibility of all Station Zero X games.
* Democratize building through the decentralized modding approach to game development.
