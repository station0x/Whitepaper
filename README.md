# Overview

## About

Station Zero-X is an emerging web3 game developer founded in late 2021 by two pseudonyms [Captain Larry and Captain Isaac](station-zero-x/team.md) and backed by a [community](station-zero-x/community.md) of builders, gamers and investors on a single mission to create mass-ready high-skill cap decentralized games that can compete with traditional gameplay while inheriting [decentralization core values](broken-reference).&#x20;

## Mission

Station Zero-X aims to develop free-to-play P2E high-skill cap games that can compete with traditional games while adding web3 core values, like [decentralized modding](governance/decentralized-modding.md), through on-chain governance, player-sovereign game assets, and [inflation-controlled](broken-reference) game token emission based on player competence.

Station Zero-X is on a **mission to liberate gamers from traditional gaming exploitation** by developing fun, open, governable and rewarding games.

## Our Vision

We imagine players empowered by getting their fair share of value from gaming and having the ability to collectively govern their immersive experiences.

## Our core values

1. **Fun-first.** Games must be intrinsically fun even with no economic incentives.
2. **Sustainable Economy.** In-game economy should be separated from protocol economy.
3. **Aligned-ecosystem through Long-term Incentivizes.** Team/Community/Investors should be economically incentivized to develop the game through long-term incentives only.
4. **NFTs with in-game utility.** NFTs should be delivered after game is already validated.
5. **Pure Meritocracy.**  Each game should have its unique-tailored meritocratic player-only owned in-game economy.
6. **Accessibility.** Games should be free-to-play with no barrier of entry. (No NFTs purchases required)
7. **Scalable Architecture.** Games architecture should be scaled easily.
8. **Agile development.** Emerging game developer should build around players feedback.
