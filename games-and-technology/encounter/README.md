[Encounter](https://encounter.station0x.com) is our first title, a 1v1 space-themed strategy board game, similar to chess, that runs in the browser. It launched in late 2021 and attracted more than 2,500 [players](https://www.notion.so/games-and-technology/encounter/community-and-statistics) during its closed beta launch.

Encounter is a chess-like strategy game with a sci-fi twist! Donâ€™t know how to play chess? Donâ€™t worry! Encounter offers a straightforward ruleset and objective.&#x20;

The match's primary objective is to destroy the enemy base with your spaceship pieces while keeping your own base secure. The game is easy to pick up, but the many unique spaceship abilities create an endless amount of strategy waiting to be discovered!

Encounter has picked up **+2500 players** since its alpha launch and is growing.
