# Revenue Generation Model



Revenue streams (Fee-based Model)

Primary:&#x20;

* Monthly battle pass&#x20;
* Weapon skin NFTs

Secondary:

* Player personalization cosmetics (player cards, sprays, weapon accessories)
* Character skins and custom animations (finishers, dances, etc)
* Secondary market NFT royalties&#x20;
