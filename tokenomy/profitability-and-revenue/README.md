# Profitability and Revenue

Station Zero X's primary revenue comes from in-game purchases of cosmetics. Other secondary revenue streams includ partnerships, in-game ads through billboards (utilizing harberger taxation), and others.

* 70% of Station Zero X revenue generated will go into the treasury which will be re-spent based on the DAO monetary policy and the remaining&#x20;
* 30% will be distributed pro rata on all locked $SZX quarterly (Every 3 months) as a rewarding mechanism. This ensures all DAO members are incentivized to hold $SZX and participate in governance to enhance the revenue generation model and accrue more value through their initial investment in the mid-long term.&#x20;
