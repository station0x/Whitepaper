# Core Design

### The Problem

Gaming industry problems&#x20;

### An Ecosystem

Unlike current traditional game industry in which capital is accrued by a central authority which control game development, mechanics and policies. Station Zero-X aim to build an ecosytem of incentivized key decision makers around games.&#x20;

Each reality's three level of government - Federal, territorial and municipal - Provide their residents with a wealth of services and programs. Governments (reality leader) collect player's tax dollars and return them in the form of security, city expansion, health care to NPCs and residents by building hospitals, roads and highways, and numerous other social benefits.

However, leaders have full ability to set negative rates (lending money instead of collecting taxes) or 100% tax rates (complete communism).&#x20;



The grand goal of governance is to be:

* Retain accrued value&#x20;
* Provide long-term incentive for DAO members



## The 3-phases launch

#### Phase A : Market Validation (PMF with no economic incentive)

This stage to validate the need for games with depth and high skill ceiling and was achieved by Encounter Launch early this year.

#### Phase B: DAO Launch and bootstrapping through Short-term Incentives (Soft Staking)

This stage aim to bootstrap tokens liquidity through prioritizing short-term gains &#x20;

#### Phase C:  Prioritizing Long-term Incentives (FILO Staking)
