# Core Design

### A decentralized ecosystem

Unlike current traditional game industry in which capital is accrued by a central authority which control game development, mechanics and policies. Station Zero-X aim to build an ecosystem of incentivized key decision makers around games.&#x20;

The grand goal of governance is to be:

* Retain accrued value&#x20;
* Provide long-term incentive for DAO members

## Our core values

1. **Fun-first.** Games must be intrinsically fun even with no economic incentives.
2. **Sustainable Economy.** In-game economy should be separated from protocol economy.
3. **Aligned-ecosystem through Long-term Incentivizes.** Team/Community/Investors should be economically incentivized to develop the game through long-term incentives only.
4. **NFTs with in-game utility.** NFTs should be delivered after game is already validated.
5. **Pure Meritocracy.**  Each game should have its unique-tailored meritocratic player-only owned in-game economy.
6. **Accessibility.** Games should be free-to-play with no barrier of entry. (No NFTs purchases required)
7. **Scalable Architecture.** Games architecture should be scaled easily.
8. **Agile development.** Emerging game developer should build around players feedback.



## The 3-phases launch

#### Phase A : Market Validation (PMF with no economic incentive)

This stage to validate the need for games with depth and high skill ceiling and was achieved by Encounter Launch early this year.

#### Phase B: DAO Launch and bootstrapping through Short-term Incentives (Soft Staking)

This stage aim to bootstrap tokens liquidity through prioritizing short-term gains &#x20;

#### Phase C:  Prioritizing Long-term Incentives (FILO Staking)
