# Game Domestic Economy

**Our games economies are separated from the DAO tokenomy.** GameFi previous experiments proved that mixing game economies with project financials tend to abuse both parties the players and stakeholders. So we designed economies to have separation of concerns.&#x20;

Each game has its own unique-tailored in-game economy that serve the game core gameplay without introducing stakeholders friction to the equation while also saving players earnings from greedy malicious traders. \
\
[Encounter](../games-and-technology/encounter/) addresses the economy inflation with its unique approach of using sophisticated and multi-step crafting process using concepts as Dutch Auctions and Ores Refining. Revenue is collected through system fee of 4% on spaceships manufacturing and royalties from secondary market reselling. \
\
[FinalCypher ](../games-and-technology/finalcypher/)sustainability comes from the demand on immersive experience through comestics and customizability during gameplay. Revenue is generated through BattlePass purchases and in-game cosmetic sales. \
\
[_DAO governance tokens_](../governance/the-ecosystem.md) _are not involved in either Encounter nor FinalCypher in-game economy or gameplay, and will not be involved in such a way in any of Station0x games._&#x20;
