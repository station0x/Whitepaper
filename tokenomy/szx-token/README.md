# $SZX - Station Zero X Token

Station Zero X tokens ($SZX) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Station Zero X[ ecosystem](../../governance/the-ecosystem.md) of Web3 competitive games on Fantom (a scalable EVM-compatible L1).&#x20;

$SZX Holders will be able to claim protocol rewards and other staking rewards through ["FILO" Staking](staking.md). While governing Station Zero X through governance voting and Its games using (DAGs Model). Players can earn allocated SZX depending on a pre-determined [vesting schedule](release-and-vesting-schedule/) as an extra reward (in addition to [the game domestic tokens](../game-domestic-economy.md) depending on each game) and a way of fair governance token distribution on the most loyal player base.&#x20;

As a web3 game builder powered at its core with a decentralized organization, the goal of $SZX is **to align incentives between major stakeholders and to decentralize the ownership of Station Zero X games,** through a [game theoretical framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_theory) built on incentivizing the most loyal members and penalize the greedy sole actors/malicious participants to eliminate public harm to glue-together the ecosystem.

SZX is designed to yield long-term rewards while empowering its holder to govern DAO economic policies, decentralized modding of games, and control Station Zero X treasury.

SZX provides its holders with the following:&#x20;

1. **Voting power.** Used in governing the ecosystem and treasury monetary policy.
2. **Rewards rights.**
3. **Modding rights.**&#x20;
