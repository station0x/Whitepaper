# Preface: The current Problems



## Problems

The current status of gaming industry contains many flaws that facilitated the way for Web3 games offer a solution.&#x20;

#### Traditional Gaming

In eyes of many

#### GameFi

In eyes of many web3 games still not there, and by some is just in its infancy. One can argue easily that infinitely issuance of in-game assets that can have real monetary value is just another [Ponzi](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/is-play-to-earn-gaming-a-ponzi-scheme).&#x20;

Unlike many web 3.0 gaming projects want you to believe, problems of video game industry are not limited to lack of tradable assets or tokens and it is most definitely _**not**_ being compensated for playing a video game (P2E?! lmao it's a ponzi maxed out). These self made problems are created only to extract value out of players without overcoming major issues in the industry.

The real problems of gaming industry are as follows:

1- Repetition and Lack of innovation when games are created by large corporate entities\
2- Lack of support for indie titles on centralized marketplaces\
3- Brutal deadlines which lead to low job quality and satisfaction among developers\
4- Lack of feedback loop from users during the development\
5- Ever growing list of features in the game which lead to increasing cost of development\
6- Lack of official support and even prohibition for user generated content (MODs)\
7- Prohibition of reselling video game assets\
8- Ever growing list of microtransactions inside the games\
9- Extremely long video games that cannot be fully enjoyed due to complexity and longevity\
\
The biggest hurdle of AAA video game development is the unsustainable business model. With costs running into hundreds of millions of dollars, only a handful of studios can risk creating these titles.

Furthermore, developing video games is an art, and not everyone is an artist. Yet every single NFT project is forced into making a metaverse or a game to "survive".&#x20;

Lastly, Investors in these projects are not gamers and cannot distinguish what is profitable at the end.

## The Solution

Web 3.0 is all about decentralization, right? If true, are you supporting the big banks that are trying to get into this space?

Same philosophy holds true for the gaming industry. Instead of supporting big centralized studios getting into this space, we need to create platforms and tools for indie developers who are driving the innovation.

That's where BrainDance comes to play:\
AA video game titles, as opposed to their counterpart, only focus on a few key features to keep the costs low and finish the development by deadlines. If a game is an MMO, it doesn't include singleplayer story driven content and vice versa.&#x20;

**The last paragraph is the solution.** _Get creators to make highly focused games that are short and sweet to play._

_**The solution that BrainDance brings to the table solves all problems detailed prior.**_&#x20;
