# Overview

**About**

Station Zero-X is a web3 game developer founded in late 2021 by two pseudonyms Captain Larry and Captain Isaac on a mission to make Play-to-Earn accessible, competitive, and truly free to play. Station Zero-X aim to develop high-skill cap games that can compete with traditional games while preserving web3 core values like decentralized modding through on-chain governance, player-sovereign game assets, and inflation-controlled game token emission based on player competence.

[Encounter](https://www.notion.so/Encounter-strategy-board-game-705e509b68f94ac5936130805aabfdee), the first game developed by Station Zero-X, is a browser-based, space-themed PvP game similar to chess with on-chain economy and manufacturing. [FinalCypher](https://www.notion.so/FinalCypher-Game-8d4359f73a5f4b318d96cd6111599d6e), the teamâ€™s most recent P developed and expected to be published late 2022. It's a 5v5 strategic First-Person Shooter game built with Unreal Engine 5.

Station Zero-X is on a mission to liberate gamers from traditional gaming exploitation by developing open, governable and rewarding games.
